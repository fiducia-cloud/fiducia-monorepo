# Repository Boundaries

`fiducia-monorepo` is the integration and GitOps superproject and is intended to
be private. It pins 25 Fiducia runtime, service, SDK, and contract repositories
to exact commits under `apps/`, but it is not the source of truth for component
ownership. Each repository keeps its own visibility, history, CI, issue surface,
and release permissions.

The independently installable `fiducia-cli.rs` repository and the private
`fiducia-infra` repository are deliberately not submodules or Zed dependencies.
The deploy workflow consumes infrastructure only through the immutable
repository/commit document at `gitops/infra-source.json` and verifies a separate
checkout before rendering. This preserves a reviewed production source without
making infrastructure part of the monorepo ownership graph.

This separation lets Fiducia make selected components open source without
exposing private control-plane, deployment, customer, or security-sensitive
history.

## Intended visibility defaults

Public or public-ready repositories:

- `fiducia-interfaces`: protocol, schema, generated language contracts.
- `fiducia-clients`: public SDKs and protocol documentation.
- `fiducia-sync`: local-first sync SDK (`@fiducia/sync`) — a zero-IO Rust
  reconcile core (also compiled to WASM) plus a thin TS shim. Consumes the
  `fiducia-interfaces` row/change-event contracts; ships no private history.
- `fiducia-test-config`: shared `node --test` browser-test harness and
  tsconfig/eslint presets (`@fiducia/test-config`). Dev-tooling only, no
  product or control-plane code — public-ready like `fiducia-interfaces`.
- `fiducia-cli.rs`: developer CLI and closest-region tooling. It is packaged and
  installed independently and is not imported by the monorepo.
- `fiducia-mcp-server.rs`: read-only MCP server (`fiducia-mcp`, stdio) giving
  MCP-capable agents diagnostics over brain/node/agent-control-plane plus an
  embedded repo map; no mutating tools, public-ready.
- `fiducia-memory.rs`: contestable claim ledger, governed durable memory, and
  explainable hybrid recall primitives and service APIs.
- `fiducia-messaging.rs`: reusable NATS subject, envelope, fencing, deduplication,
  and optional Postgres/JetStream relay primitives.
- `fiducia-payments.rs`: provider-agnostic Stripe and PayPal webhook signature
  verification and event parsing; pure library code with no server or database.
- `fiducia-ai-agent-manager.rs`: AI-agent lifecycle/dispatch manager; server-auth
  gated, with per-provider child-env isolation.
- `fiducia-lambda-service.rs`: sandboxed function/runner dispatch service with
  request-body limits and server-auth-gated mutating routes.
- `fiducia-routing.rs`: region enum and deterministic routing helpers.
- `fiducia-marketing.web`: public marketing/product web surface.

Private repositories by default:

- `fiducia-monorepo`: all-up GitOps pins, including private service submodules.
- `fiducia-infra`: cluster topology, generated deployment state, and ops docs.
  It remains external to the monorepo and is selected by immutable commit.
- `fiducia-node.rs`: core coordination engine and shard internals.
- `fiducia-brain.rs`: control plane and placement logic.
- `fiducia-load-balance.rs`: leader-routing and fleet topology behavior.
- `fiducia-auth.rs`: auth integration, key handling, and trust policy.
- `fiducia-admin.rs`: internal admin and operator APIs.
- `fiducia-ai-agent-bridge.rs`: customer-operated, topic-routed AI-agent
  conversation bus, transport hardening, and optional message persistence.
- `fiducia-ai-agent-control-plane`: single-tenant, customer-operated agent
  orchestration, source context, model workflows, memory, and audit state.
- `fiducia-customer.rs`: customer portal backend integration.
- `fiducia-customer-ui.web`: deprecated legacy customer SPA (archived; superseded by `fiducia-customer.rs`, no longer a monorepo submodule).
- `fiducia-node-sidecar.rs`: node-local bridge and heartbeat logic.
- `fiducia-operations-control-plane`: single-tenant deployment, migration,
  scheduling, runner, rollout, and infrastructure audit state.
- `fiducia-edge`: edge routing and deployment-adjacent policy.
- `fiducia-e2e`: cross-cluster conformance and chaos test orchestration.
- `fiducia-telemetry.rs`: internal tracing conventions and service metadata.

## Live visibility snapshot

The live GitHub audit on 2026-07-13 found four private application repositories:
`fiducia-ai-agent-bridge.rs`, `fiducia-ai-agent-control-plane`, `fiducia-e2e`,
and `fiducia-operations-control-plane`. Every other repository in this workspace,
including `fiducia-monorepo`, was public. That is a policy mismatch for twelve
repositories listed as private-by-default above. Visibility is an owner-level
release decision because changing it affects forks, collaborators, disclosure,
and automation; this code audit therefore reports the mismatch without changing
GitHub settings.

Trusted `main` fleet-audit runs and production checkout use a read-only
fine-grained `FIDUCIA_SUBMODULE_TOKEN` so private service submodules and the
separately pinned infra repository are never silently omitted from a deployable
state audit. Public PR contract CI intentionally initializes only
`fiducia-interfaces` and `fiducia-sync`; it still verifies all 25 declarations
as exact gitlinks without requesting private repository data. The token belongs
in GitHub Environments/secrets, never in this repository.

## Rules

- Restore the all-up superproject to private unless an owner explicitly accepts
  the audited public posture and confirms every submodule URL and pin is safe
  for public consumption.
- Use a separate public-only superproject if contributors need a single checkout
  across public components.
- Keep `fiducia-cli.rs` and `fiducia-infra` out of both `.gitmodules` and the
  monorepo's Zed dependencies.
- Update `gitops/infra-source.json` through review whenever production should
  consume a different infrastructure commit; never use a branch or tag there.
- Do not commit real `.env*` files, private keys, tokens, certificates, or
  generated secret bundles. Use `.env.example` for placeholders and keep real
  values in ignored local files or secret managers.
- Treat service submodule pins and the external infra source commit as
  deployable state. A component change is not deployable through GitOps until
  the component repo is pushed and the appropriate reviewed pin is updated.
- Open-source candidates should keep public contracts in `fiducia-interfaces`
  and SDK repos. Private repos may consume those contracts without leaking
  implementation details back into public history.
